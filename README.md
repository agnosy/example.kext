# Makefile for building macOS kernel extensions

## Overview

`Mk/kext.mk` is a makefile for building macOS kernel extensions without the
opaque Xcode project bloat.

This example kernel extension for macOS demonstrates how to use `Mk/kext.mk`.

All this is by no means rocket science, but since there exists very little
up-to-date documentation on how to build kernel extensions manually, this might
save other inclined kernel hackers with a dislike for GUI based build
configuration some relief.


## Requirements

Tested primarily on El Capitan 10.11.6 (XNU 3248.72.11).  Patches to support
other macOS releases are very welcome.


## Installation

As of OS X 10.10 Yosemite, kernel extensions need to be signed.  You need to
enable `kext-dev-mode` in order to load unsigned kernel extensions:

1.  Run `sudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1`
2.  Reboot

As of OS X 10.11 El Capitan, `kext-dev-mode` no longer has any effect.  You
need to disable the kext protection part of System Integrity Protection (SIP)
in order to load unsigned kernel extensions:

1.  Boot into repair mode by pressing <kbd>cmdâŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> during boot
2.  Run `csrutil enable --without kext`
3.  Reboot

To create a signed kext that will load in default system configuration with SIP
enabled, you will need to obtain a Developer ID certificate specifically for
signing kernel extensions.


## Support

There is no support whatsoever.  No communication except in the form of Github
pull requests or issues pertaining to bugs or missing features.


## Bugs

-   `Mk/kext.mk` does not support targeting a specific version of macOS.
-   `Mk/kext.mk` only compiles c sources at this point (but you might think
    that abominations such as C++ do not belong in kernelspace anyway).
